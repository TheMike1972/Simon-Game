# H1 Vintage Simon Game by MichaÃ«l Biezin

Simon is an electronic game from the 70's, which I used to play and loved. It is a memory game, based on the Simon Says game (Jacques a dit, in French).
The machine displays a sequence of lights and sounds that the player is expected to replicate. It starts with one, and everytime the player succeeds,
the sequence is augmented by one more. The sequence can go up to 20, unless the player loses before.

## H2 Why it was an interesting project

Given the time we had, I wanted to focus on a simple but complete game, with an interesting JavaScript function of comparing the two arrays the program
and the player are building with the sequences they are playing. It was also an interesting CSS challenge, reproducing the visual of the game of my childhood.

## H2 Key features

- Interesting visual effect
- Fun sounds
- simple and efficient gameplay

## H2 What is next?

- several speeds of the game;
- an implimentation of a responsive feature;
- a non-strict mode;
- alternative designs and sounds.
